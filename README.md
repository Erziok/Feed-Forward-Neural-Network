# Feed Forward Neural Network

A feed forward neural network developed for deep learning class, this project works with de MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset. This dataset contains 60.000 training and 10.000 test images, with each grayscale image having 28x28 pixels.

In this case, we use 3 activation functions (ReLu, Sigmoid and Tanh) and 3 optimizers (Adam, SGD and RMSprop)
